Find all simple cycles in a directed graph

Python's networkx.simple_cycles is the reference implementation. A small graph (graph20) and a large graph
(graph200) are provided in the data directory, stored in networkx's adjacency_list format. This format is one
line for each node, with each line being a space separated list of node ids. The first id is the id of the node,
and the subsequent ids are the ids of each target of an outgoing edge from the node.

The provided graph20 has 89 cycles
